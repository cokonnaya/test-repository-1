## About

\
This blindtext illustrates that (hopefully) many project groups will put up their project description as first section of the readme.md file. The goal of DUAW is creating a platform for documenting TL final projects, letting students showcase their work and get in contact with each other, especially with former students from prior semesters. If a group wants to showcase their project on DUAW, all they need is their already existing repository where they add a project information file provided by us plus some images (such as screenshots which tell the story of the project process). This information then gets rendered and beautifully presented on DUAW, allowing interested persons to browse though the projects of different semesters, locations or categories, vote on them, provide feedback or get in contact with the project team.
